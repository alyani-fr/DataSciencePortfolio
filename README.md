<h2>💡Tableau Dashboard Projects</h2>

👩‍💻 **Project 1: Netflix Movies & TV Shows Dashboard**</b>

*Description:* The aim for this project is to create a Tableau dashboard that can help users gain insights of an existing dataset for Netflix's movies and tv shows. The dashboard will show visualizations of the numbers of movies and tv shows being distributed on Netflix per year, by genres, countries, and ratings. The total number of each movies and tv shows dstribution will also be visualized to compare the statistics between the two.

👩‍💻 **Project 2: Covid-19 Worldwide Vaccine Tracker**</b>

*Description:* The purpose of this project is to create Covid-19 vaccination tracker to see how they are performing across the world. The users will be able to see the different distributions between percentage of people that are fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated for every country and if the GDP per capita of a country affect the vaccination programs.
