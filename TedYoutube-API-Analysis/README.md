**Description:** The objective of this project is to analyze the TED YouTube data by implementing API scraping technique on the YouTube Data API. I'll extract the data and then load it into a pandas dataframe so that further analysis can be done. Finally, a simple visualization using seaborn library will also be made to present the insights gathered by performing an exploratory analysis on the data.

**Data Source:** This project started by first creating a YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access the YouTube data. Once the API Key is generated, the documentation prepared by google is skeemed over to learn how to use the API Key in order to access different YouTube data. One more important key is the TED YouTube channel id that can be obtained from YouTube itself.

**Libraries:**
- The google-api-python-client method is imported prior to this project so that I can make the API call.
- Pandas is use to build the dataframes, performing analytical tasks on the dataframes.
- Seaborn is a visualization libraries that are build on matplotlib and is used to visualize insights.
- NLP for human language processing in order to generate a wordcloud of the videos' titles.

**Sections Covered:**
- Data Acquisition
- Data Pre-processing/Data Cleaning
- Data Exploration & Visualization
- Cloud Database
